## Documentation Guidelines

1. **File Naming Conventions**
   - Use UPPERCASE for main documentation files (e.g., README.md, SETUP.md)
   - Use kebab-case for specific topic documentation (e.g., api-authentication.md)
   - Use descriptive, consistent prefixes for related documents

2. **Documentation Location**
   - Project-wide documentation belongs in `/docs/` and its subdirectories
   - Service-specific documentation belongs in `/services/{service-name}/docs/`
   - Implementation details should be in service-specific docs
   - Architecture and design decisions should be in project-wide docs

3. **Cross-referencing**
   - Use relative links when referencing other documentation files
   - Always use the format `[Link Text](./relative/path/to/file.md)`
   - Include section anchors when linking to specific sections: `[Link Text](./file.md#section)`

4. **Keeping Documentation Updated**
   - Update documentation when making significant code changes
   - Add new documentation for new features
   - Review and update existing documentation periodically
   - Mark outdated documentation with a note at the top and create a task to update it

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. Place it in the appropriate directory based on its scope and purpose
2. Follow the naming conventions
3. Update this README.md file if adding a new major document
4. Update the main project README.md if the document should be featured there
