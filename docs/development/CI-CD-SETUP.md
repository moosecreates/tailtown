# CI/CD Setup Documentation

## Overview

Tailtown uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and continuous integration. Tests run automatically on every push and pull request to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

## Workflows

### 1. Frontend Tests (`frontend-tests.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main`, `sept25-stable`, or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to these branches
- Only runs when frontend files change

**What it does:**
1. Sets up Node.js 18.x environment
2. Installs dependencies with `npm ci`
3. Runs timezone handling tests
4. Runs dashboard-calendar sync tests
5. Runs all tests with coverage reporting
6. Uploads coverage to Codecov (optional)
7. Comments test results on pull requests

**Duration:** ~2-3 minutes

### 2. Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main`, `sept25-stable`, or `develop` branches
- All pull requests

**What it does:**

#### Frontend Job:
1. TypeScript type checking
2. Timezone handling tests
3. Dashboard-calendar sync tests
4. All unit tests with coverage
5. Production build verification
6. Build size reporting

#### Backend Job:
1. TypeScript type checking for each service
2. Prisma schema validation
3. Dependency installation verification

**Duration:** ~3-5 minutes

## Test Coverage

### Critical Tests
- **Timezone Handling** (9 tests)
  - Date extraction from UTC timestamps
  - Midnight crossing edge cases
  - DST transitions
  - Cross-timezone consistency

- **Dashboard-Calendar Sync** (9 tests)
  - IN/OUT/OVERNIGHT count accuracy
  - Calendar occupancy matching
  - Edge case validation

### Coverage Reports
Coverage reports are generated and can be viewed in:
- GitHub Actions artifacts
- Codecov dashboard (if configured)
- Local: `frontend/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`

## Status Badges

The README displays real-time status badges:

```markdown
![CI Status](https://github.com/moosecreates/tailtown/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)
![Frontend Tests](https://github.com/moosecreates/tailtown/workflows/Frontend%20Tests/badge.svg)
```

- 🟢 Green = All tests passing
- 🔴 Red = Tests failing
- 🟡 Yellow = Tests running

## Viewing Test Results

### In GitHub:
1. Go to the repository on GitHub
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Select a workflow run
4. View detailed logs and test results

### Locally:
```bash
cd frontend
npm test                      # Run all tests
npm test -- --coverage        # Run with coverage
npm test -- --watch           # Watch mode
```

## Handling Test Failures

### When Tests Fail in CI:

1. **Check the logs:**
   - Click on the failed workflow in GitHub Actions
   - Expand the failed step to see error details

2. **Common failures:**
   - **Timezone tests fail**: Check if Date object usage is correct
   - **Sync tests fail**: Verify dashboard and calendar use same logic
   - **Build fails**: Check for TypeScript errors or missing dependencies

3. **Fix locally:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm test                    # Reproduce the failure
   # Fix the issue
   npm test                    # Verify fix
   git commit -m "Fix: ..."
   git push                    # Re-trigger CI
   ```

## Required Checks for Merging

### Pull Request Requirements:
- ✅ All frontend tests must pass
- ✅ TypeScript must compile without errors
- ✅ Build must complete successfully
- ✅ No critical timezone bugs introduced

### Branch Protection Rules (Recommended):
```yaml
# In GitHub Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules
- Require status checks to pass before merging
  - frontend-tests
  - ci / frontend-tests
  - ci / backend-health-check
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
```

## Skipping CI (Emergency Only)

To skip CI on a commit (use sparingly):
```bash
git commit -m "docs: Update README [skip ci]"
```

## Local Pre-commit Testing

### Option 1: Manual
```bash
# Before committing
cd frontend && npm test
```

### Option 2: Husky (Automated)
Install Husky to run tests automatically:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install --save-dev husky
npx husky install
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "cd frontend && npm test"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Tests passed locally but fail in CI"

**Possible causes:**
1. **Timezone differences**: CI runs in UTC, local may be different
   - Solution: Tests should work in any timezone
   - Check: Date object usage, not string splitting

2. **Node version mismatch**: CI uses Node 18.x
   - Solution: Use same version locally with nvm
   ```bash
   nvm use 18
   ```

3. **Dependency issues**: CI uses `npm ci` (clean install)
   - Solution: Delete node_modules and run `npm ci` locally

### "CI is taking too long"

**Optimizations:**
1. Use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` (faster, more reliable)
2. Cache node_modules between runs (already configured)
3. Run only changed tests (requires configuration)
4. Parallelize test suites (future enhancement)

### "Coverage upload fails"

This is non-critical. The workflow continues even if Codecov upload fails.
To fix:
1. Add `CODECOV_TOKEN` to GitHub Secrets
2. Or remove the coverage upload step

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements:
- [ ] E2E tests with Playwright
- [ ] Visual regression testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Automated deployment to staging
- [ ] Slack/Discord notifications
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Docker image building and testing

### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Backend API integration tests
- [ ] Database migration tests
- [ ] Service-to-service communication tests

## Configuration Files

### `.github/workflows/frontend-tests.yml`
Focused on frontend testing with detailed test reporting.

### `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
Comprehensive CI including frontend, backend, and build verification.

### `frontend/package.json`
Test scripts configuration:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "test:ci": "react-scripts test --watchAll=false --coverage"
  }
}
```

## Monitoring

### GitHub Actions Usage:
- Free tier: 2,000 minutes/month for private repos
- Public repos: Unlimited
- Current usage: ~5 minutes per push (frontend + backend)

### Notifications:
- Email notifications for failed workflows (default)
- Can configure Slack/Discord webhooks
- GitHub mobile app shows status

## Best Practices

1. **Write tests first**: TDD approach prevents CI failures
2. **Run tests locally**: Before pushing to avoid CI failures
3. **Keep tests fast**: Target <5 minutes total CI time
4. **Fix failures immediately**: Don't let broken tests accumulate
5. **Monitor coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage
6. **Review CI logs**: Even when passing, check for warnings

## Support

For CI/CD issues:
1. Check workflow logs in GitHub Actions
2. Review this documentation
3. Check `frontend/src/__tests__/README.md` for test details
4. Review `docs/development/TIMEZONE-FIX-SUMMARY.md` for timezone issues
