## 📝 Notes

### Analytics & Reporting Implementation
- Revenue totals come from invoices, not reservations
- Totals sum `Invoice.total` filtered by `issueDate` and status
- Create invoices via New Order UI or `POST /api/invoices`
- Link `reservationId` for proper reporting
- Add-on revenue requires reservation add-ons and linked invoices
- Time-period filters use `getDateFilter()` on invoice `issueDate`

### Development Environment
- PostgreSQL on port 5433
- Consistent database URL format across services
- Schema synchronization between services
- Enhanced tenant middleware for development mode
