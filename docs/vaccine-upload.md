   - Solution: Select a supported file type

2. **File Too Large**
   - Message: "File size exceeds 10MB limit."
   - Solution: Compress or resize the file

3. **Pet Not Found**
   - Message: "Pet not found"
   - Solution: Verify the pet ID and tenant context

4. **Upload Failed**

## Best Practices

### For Customers

1. **Use Clear Photos**: Take well-lit, focused photos of vaccine records
2. **Correct Orientation**: Ensure documents are right-side up
3. **File Format**: Use JPG or PDF for best compatibility
4. **File Size**: Keep files under 5MB for faster uploads
5. **Organization**: Upload all vaccine records for complete history

### For Staff

1. **Verification**: Review uploaded records for completeness
2. **Quality Check**: Ensure documents are legible
3. **Follow-up**: Request better quality if needed
4. **Documentation**: Add notes about vaccine status in pet profile
5. **Compliance**: Verify records meet facility requirements

### For Developers

1. **Tenant Context**: Always include tenant headers in API calls
2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and user feedback
3. **File Cleanup**: Ensure failed uploads clean up temporary files
4. **Security**: Never expose file paths or internal structure
5. **Testing**: Test with various file types and sizes

## Migration

### Database Migration

The system includes a safe migration script that adds the `vaccineRecordFiles` column without losing data:

```bash
node services/customer/prisma/migrations/add_vaccine_record_files.js
```

This script:
- Adds the column if it doesn't exist
- Uses `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`
- Preserves all existing data
- Safe to run multiple times

### Prisma Schema Update

After migration, regenerate Prisma client:

```bash
cd services/customer
npx prisma generate
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Upload Test**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:4004/api/pets/{petId}/vaccine-records/upload \
     -H "x-tenant-id: dev" \
     -H "x-tenant-subdomain: dev" \
     -F "file=@/path/to/vaccine.jpg"
   ```

2. **List Files Test**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:4004/api/pets/{petId}/vaccine-records \
     -H "x-tenant-id: dev" \
     -H "x-tenant-subdomain: dev"
   ```

3. **Download Test**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:4004/api/pets/{petId}/vaccine-records/{filename}/download \
     -H "x-tenant-id: dev" \
     -H "x-tenant-subdomain: dev" \
     -o downloaded-file.jpg
   ```

4. **Delete Test**
   ```bash
   curl -X DELETE http://localhost:4004/api/pets/{petId}/vaccine-records/{filename} \
     -H "x-tenant-id: dev" \
     -H "x-tenant-subdomain: dev"
   ```

### Frontend Testing

1. Open pet profile page
2. Click "Select File" and choose a vaccine record
