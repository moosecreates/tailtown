## Best Practices

### Compliance

1. **Opt-Out**: Always include "Reply STOP to opt out" in marketing messages
2. **Consent**: Only send to customers who have opted in
3. **Timing**: Send messages during business hours (9 AM - 8 PM)
4. **Frequency**: Limit marketing messages to avoid spam
5. **TCPA Compliance**: Follow Telephone Consumer Protection Act guidelines

### Message Content

1. **Be Concise**: SMS has 160-character limit (longer messages are split)
2. **Include Business Name**: Start with your business name for recognition
3. **Clear Call-to-Action**: Make it obvious what the customer should do
4. **Contact Info**: Include phone number for questions
5. **Professional Tone**: Keep messages friendly but professional

### Automation

1. **Appointment Reminders**: Send 24 hours before appointment
2. **Confirmations**: Send immediately after booking
3. **Check-In/Out**: Send in real-time
4. **Welcome Messages**: Send within 1 hour of customer creation
5. **Marketing**: Schedule during optimal times

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

1. **Invalid Phone Number**
   - Error: "Invalid phone number format"
   - Solution: Ensure phone number is in valid format

2. **Customer Has No Phone**
   - Error: "Customer phone number not available"
   - Solution: Update customer record with phone number

3. **Twilio Not Configured**
   - Behavior: Messages logged but not sent
   - Solution: Add Twilio credentials to .env

4. **Twilio API Error**
   - Error: Twilio-specific error message
   - Solution: Check Twilio account status and balance

### Graceful Fallback

When Twilio is not configured:
- Messages are logged to console
- API returns success with mock message ID
- No errors thrown
- System continues to function normally

## Testing

### Without Twilio (Development)

```bash
# Messages will be logged to console
POST /api/sms/test
{
  "phoneNumber": "+1234567890",
  "message": "Test message"
}
```

**Console Output:**
```
📱 SMS (Twilio not configured):
To: +1234567890
Message: Test message
---
```

### With Twilio (Production)

1. Configure Twilio credentials in .env
2. Use Twilio trial number for testing
3. Verify phone number in Twilio console
4. Send test message
5. Check Twilio logs for delivery status

## Monitoring

### Twilio Console

- View message logs
- Check delivery status
- Monitor usage and costs
- Review error reports

### Application Logs

```bash
# Successful send
✅ SMS sent successfully: SM...

# Error
❌ Error sending SMS: [error message]
```

## Cost Considerations

### Twilio Pricing (US)

- **SMS**: ~$0.0079 per message
- **Phone Number**: ~$1.15/month
- **Trial Account**: Free credits for testing

### Optimization Tips

1. **Batch Messages**: Send multiple messages efficiently
2. **Opt-Out Management**: Don't send to opted-out customers
3. **Message Length**: Keep under 160 characters to avoid splits
4. **Timing**: Send during business hours to reduce waste

## Integration Examples

### Automatic Reminder Cron Job

```typescript
// Send reminders for tomorrow's appointments
import cron from 'node-cron';
import { smsService } from './services/sms.service';

cron.schedule('0 9 * * *', async () => {
  const tomorrow = new Date();
  tomorrow.setDate(tomorrow.getDate() + 1);
  
  const reservations = await getReservationsForDate(tomorrow);
  
  for (const reservation of reservations) {
    if (reservation.customer.phone) {
      await smsService.sendAppointmentReminder({
        customerName: reservation.customer.name,
        customerPhone: reservation.customer.phone,
        petName: reservation.pet.name,
        serviceName: reservation.service.name,
        startDate: reservation.startDate,
        tenantName: 'Tailtown Pet Resort',
      });
    }
  }
});
```

### Post-Checkout Confirmation

```typescript
// After checkout, send confirmation
app.post('/api/checkout/complete', async (req, res) => {
  const { reservationId } = req.body;
  
  // Process payment...
  
  // Send SMS confirmation
  await fetch(`http://localhost:4004/api/sms/reservation-confirmation/${reservationId}`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'x-tenant-id': 'dev',
      'x-tenant-subdomain': 'dev'
    }
  });
  
  res.json({ success: true });
});
```

## Troubleshooting

5. **Audit Logs**: Log all SMS sends for compliance
