## Enrollment Process Flow

### 1. **Validation**
System checks:
- ✅ Class exists
- ✅ Class is not full
- ✅ Pet is not already enrolled
- ✅ Customer and pet are valid

### 2. **Enrollment Creation**
System creates:
- Enrollment record
- Links pet to class
- Sets payment status
- Calculates amount due

### 3. **Class Update**
System updates:
- Increments `currentEnrolled` count
- Removes pet from waitlist (if present)

### 4. **Confirmation**
- Enrollment appears in class roster
- Customer receives confirmation (TODO: email)
- Pet can attend sessions

---

## Managing Enrollments

### View Enrollments

**Navigate to Class Enrollments**:
```
/training/classes/:classId/enrollments
```

**Shows**:
- List of all enrolled pets
- Customer information
- Payment status
- Attendance record
- Completion status

### Update Enrollment

**Available Actions**:
- **Mark Complete**: When pet finishes all sessions

### Drop from Class

**Process**:

2. Confirm action
3. System:

   - Decrements class count
   - Notifies first person on waitlist

---

## Waitlist Management

### When Class is Full

If enrollment fails due to capacity:
```json
{
  "error": "Class is full. Pet can be added to waitlist."
}
```

### Add to Waitlist

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/training-classes/:classId/waitlist`

**Request**:
```json
{
  "petId": "pet-uuid",
  "customerId": "customer-uuid"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": "waitlist-uuid",
    "position": 3,
    "addedDate": "2025-10-26T00:00:00Z",
    "notified": false
  }
}
```

### Waitlist Features
- **Position Tracking**: Shows place in line
- **Auto-Notification**: Alerts when spot opens
- **Auto-Enrollment**: Can enroll directly from waitlist
- **Position Reordering**: Maintains order when people drop

---

## Payment Management

### Payment Status

**Statuses**:
- `PENDING`: Not paid or partially paid
- `PAID`: Fully paid
- `REFUNDED`: Payment refunded

### Payment Calculation

```typescript
// Automatic calculation
if (amountPaid >= pricePerSeries) {
  paymentStatus = 'PAID';
} else if (amountPaid > 0) {
  paymentStatus = 'PARTIAL';
} else {
  paymentStatus = 'PENDING';
}

amountDue = pricePerSeries - amountPaid;
```

### Update Payment

**Endpoint**: `PUT /api/enrollments/:id`

**Request**:
```json
{
  "amountPaid": 200.00,
  "paymentStatus": "PAID"
}
```

---

## Attendance Tracking

### Mark Attendance

**Per Session**:
1. Navigate to class session
2. View roster
3. Mark each pet as:
   - **PRESENT**: Attended
   - **ABSENT**: Did not attend
   - **EXCUSED**: Excused absence

### Attendance Stats

**Automatically Calculated**:
- `attendedSessions`: Count of PRESENT
- `totalSessions`: Total class sessions
- `attendanceRate`: Percentage attended

### Completion Criteria

**Requirements**:
- Attended minimum sessions (e.g., 80%)
- Payment status is PAID
- All sessions completed

---

## Certificates

### Issue Certificate

**When**:
- Enrollment status is COMPLETED
- Attendance requirements met
- Payment is complete

**Process**:
1. Click "Issue Certificate" button
2. System:
   - Sets `certificateIssued = true`
   - Records `certificateDate`
   - Generates certificate (TODO: PDF)

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/enrollments/:id/certificate`
