# Kennel Management Code Cleanup

## Overview
This document outlines the code cleanup and refactoring performed on the Kennel Management feature after fixing the suite status display issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Date Handling Utility
- Created a new utility file `dateUtils.ts` to centralize date formatting logic
- Implemented `formatDateToYYYYMMDD()` function to consistently format dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Replaced all instances of manual date formatting with the utility function

### 2. Reduced Verbose Logging
- Removed excessive console.log statements throughout the codebase
- Kept only essential logging needed for debugging
- Simplified logging messages to be more concise

### 3. Code Simplification
- Removed redundant date formatting code in multiple components
- Simplified conditional logic where possible
- Improved code readability by removing unnecessary comments and verbose code

### 4. Affected Files
- `/frontend/src/utils/dateUtils.ts` (new file)
- `/frontend/src/pages/suites/SuitesPage.tsx`
- `/frontend/src/components/suites/SuiteBoard.tsx`
- `/frontend/src/services/resourceService.ts`

## Benefits
- **Improved Maintainability**: Centralized date formatting logic makes future changes easier
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminated repeated date formatting code
- **Better Performance**: Reduced unnecessary console logging
- **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed verbose and redundant code
- **Consistent Date Handling**: Ensured all components use the same date formatting approach

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding more utility functions for common operations
- Further refactor status determination logic into a shared utility
- Add unit tests for the date utility functions
