# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical work-in-progress documents that have been superseded by final versions or are no longer relevant for future development.

**Archived:** October 30, 2025

## Why These Were Archived

These documents were useful during development but are no longer needed:
- **Progress/Status Docs:** Superseded by final completion documents
- **Planning Docs:** Work completed, plans executed
- **Session Summaries:** Historical records, not reference material
- **Old Strategies:** Superseded by implemented solutions
- **Bug Fix Docs:** Issues resolved, fixes implemented

## What Remains in Main Docs

The main `/docs` directory now contains only:
- **Reference Documentation:** System features, APIs, guides
- **Current Status:** MVP readiness, roadmap
- **Completion Docs:** Final versions showing what was built
- **Implementation Guides:** How systems work
