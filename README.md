# Tailtown Pet Resort Management System

A modern, full-featured management system for pet resorts, providing comprehensive tools for reservations, customer management, and pet care services.

## Features

### Customer Management
- Customer profiles with contact information
- Pet profiles with medical history, vaccination records
- Multiple pets per customer
- Document storage for forms and agreements

### Reservation System
- Interactive calendar interface
- Real-time availability checking
- Multiple service types (daycare, boarding, grooming)
- Color-coded reservation status
- Drag-and-drop scheduling
- Specialized kennel grid calendar for boarding and daycare
- Compact view for efficient kennel management
- Seamless add-on service selection workflow
- Consistent reservation experience across all service types
- Unique order number system for easy reference (format: RES-YYYYMMDD-001)
- Comprehensive add-on services management

### Invoicing and Payments
- Automatic invoice generation for reservations
- Detailed invoice view with line items
- Service and add-on itemization
- Configurable tax rate (7.44%)
- Payment tracking and history
- Customer account balance management
- Invoice status tracking (draft, sent, paid, etc.)

### Environment Setup
- Each service has its own `.env` file in its respective directory
- Frontend environment file: `/frontend/.env`
- Reservation service environment file: `/services/reservation-service/.env`
  - **Critical**: `DATABASE_URL` must be set to port 5433 for the reservation service to connect to PostgreSQL
- Customer service environment file: `/services/customer/.env`
- Key environment variables:
  - `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (format: `postgresql://username:password@localhost:5433/customer?schema=public`)
  - `PORT`: Service port number (4004 for customer service, 4003 for reservation service)
  - `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (development, test, production)
  - `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for authentication
- **Shared Database Approach**: Both customer and reservation services use the same PostgreSQL database
  - Prisma schemas must be synchronized between services to avoid runtime errors
  - Field names must be consistent across services (e.g., `birthdate` not `age` for Pet model)
- For a complete list of all environment variables and their descriptions, see our detailed [Environment Variables Documentation](./docs/Environment-Variables.md)
- For service architecture and port assignments, see our [Service Architecture Documentation](./docs/architecture/SERVICE-ARCHITECTURE.md)

### Service Management

  - Filter resources by one or more types (e.g., `STANDARD_SUITE`, `LUXURY_SUITE`)
  - Robust validation and error handling for resource type parameters
- Multi-tenant support for all resource operations

### Staff Management
- Staff profiles with contact information
- Enhanced scheduling with compact time display
- Starting location assignment for shifts
- Time-off requests and approval workflow
- Performance tracking

### Settings & Configuration
- Centralized system settings
- User management

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- Material-UI for components
- FullCalendar for scheduling
- JWT authentication
- Responsive design

### Backend
- Express.js with TypeScript
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL database
- RESTful API architecture
- JWT-based authentication
- Graceful error handling for schema mismatches

## Development Guidelines

### Schema Alignment and Database Migration
We've implemented a comprehensive approach to handle Prisma schema mismatches and database migrations:

#### Schema Alignment Strategy
- Backend controllers use defensive programming to handle missing tables/fields
- Raw SQL queries with try/catch blocks for tables that may not exist in all environments
- Graceful fallbacks to empty arrays or default values when schema elements are missing
- TypeScript type safety with explicit typing for raw query results

#### Schema Validation System
- Comprehensive schema validation on service startup
- Detailed reporting of missing tables, columns, indexes, and relationships
- Automatic generation of SQL migration scripts to fix schema issues
- Optional automatic migration capability for development environments
- Clear guidance and recommendations for resolving schema mismatches
- Two-step approach for Prisma operations with type compatibility issues (see TypeScript Improvements)

#### Database Migration Tools
- Raw SQL migration scripts for creating critical tables and columns
- Migration runner script with error handling and transaction support
- Database connection test utility to diagnose connectivity issues

#### TypeScript Improvements
- Enhanced module resolution configuration for better import handling
- Fixed type compatibility issues between extended and standard Prisma input types
- Implemented defensive programming patterns for TypeScript type safety

#### Test Improvements
- Implemented robust testing patterns for controllers with proper mocking
- Fixed circular dependency issues in test files
- Created comprehensive test coverage for all CRUD operations
- Documented test patterns in a detailed Testing Guide
- Improved test reliability with consistent mocking and assertions
- Detailed documentation in `services/reservation-service/docs/TYPESCRIPT-FIXES.md`
- Detailed schema validation reporting on service startup

This approach ensures the API remains stable even when the schema evolves or differs between environments. For detailed migration instructions, see our [Database Migration Guide](./services/reservation-service/DATABASE-MIGRATION.md).

### API Service Layer
We've implemented a shared API service layer to ensure consistency across all microservices as we transition to a domain-driven architecture. The API layer provides:
- Standardized API response formats
- Multi-tenancy support via middleware
- Consistent error handling
- Request validation with Zod
- Service factory for quick bootstrapping

See [API Service Layer Documentation](./docs/architecture/API-SERVICE-LAYER.md) for implementation details and migration guidelines.

### Data Modeling Strategy
We've adopted a balanced approach to data modeling that maintains domain boundaries while optimizing for performance at scale. Key strategies include:
- Keeping core domain models properly normalized
- Creating specialized read models for performance-critical operations
- Strategic denormalization for common query patterns
- Optimized indexing strategy for multi-tenant queries
- Partitioning approach for time-series data like reservations

See [Data Modeling Strategy](./docs/architecture/DATA-MODELING-STRATEGY.md) for the complete approach and implementation guidelines.

  ```

### Production Considerations
- For production deployments, consider using a cloud storage solution (e.g., AWS S3)
- Ensure proper backup of the uploads directory
- Implement regular cleanup of the temp directory
- Monitor disk space usage
