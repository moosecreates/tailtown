# E2E Tests with Playwright

## Overview

End-to-end tests that simulate real user interactions with the Tailtown application. These tests validate complete user flows from start to finish across the entire application stack.

## Test Suites

### 1. `reservation-flow.spec.ts` (5 tests)

Tests complete reservation workflows:

- ✅ **Create boarding reservation with kennel assignment**
  - Navigate to kennel calendar
  - Select customer and pet
  - Choose boarding service
  - Assign kennel (with availability indicators)
  - Submit and verify on calendar/dashboard

- ✅ **Prevent double-booking same kennel**
  - Attempt to book occupied kennel
  - Verify occupied kennels show red indicator
  - Verify occupied kennels are disabled

- ✅ **Edit existing reservation and change kennel**
  - Open reservation from list
  - Edit kennel assignment
  - Verify current kennel shows as available
  - Save changes

- ✅ **Create grooming reservation without kennel**
  - Select grooming service
  - Verify kennel selector does NOT appear
  - Submit successfully

  - Verify individual kennel selectors per pet
  - Assign different kennels to each pet
  - Submit successfully

### 2. `kennel-management.spec.ts` (10 tests)

Tests kennel board and print functionality:

- ✅ **Display kennel board with all kennels**
  - Verify summary cards (Total, Available, Occupied)
  - Verify kennel cards show alphanumeric IDs (A01, not just 0)

## Configuration

### `playwright.config.ts`

Key settings:
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Timeout**: 60 seconds per test
- **Retries**: 2 on CI, 0 locally
- **Parallel**: Yes (except on CI)
- **Screenshots**: On failure
- **Videos**: On failure
- **Trace**: On first retry

### Browsers Tested

- ✅ Microsoft Edge
- ✅ Google Chrome

## Test Structure

### Test Organization

```typescript
test.describe('Feature Name', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    // Setup before each test
  });

  test('should do something', async ({ page }) => {
    await test.step('Step 1', async () => {
      // Test step 1
    });
    
    await test.step('Step 2', async () => {
      // Test step 2
    });
  });
});
```

### Best Practices

#### ✅ DO
- Use `test.step()` for clear test organization
- Wait for elements before interacting
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure paths
- Verify UI feedback after actions
- Use appropriate timeouts
- Clean up test data if needed

#### ❌ DON'T
- Use fixed waits (`waitForTimeout`) unless necessary
- Assume element positions
- Test implementation details
- Share state between tests
- Use production data
- Skip error handling

## Debugging

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Run with debugger
npx playwright test --debug

# Debug specific test
npx playwright test reservation-flow --debug
```

### Inspect Element

```bash
# Open Playwright Inspector
npx playwright codegen http://localhost:3000
```

### View Trace

```bash
# View trace for failed test
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

### Screenshots and Videos

After test failures:
- Screenshots: `test-results/*/test-failed-*.png`
- Videos: `test-results/*/video.webm`
- Traces: `test-results/*/trace.zip`

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: E2E Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Install Playwright Browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      
      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: npx playwright test
      
      - name: Upload test results
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Set base URL
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Enable CI mode
CI=true

# Set specific browser
BROWSER=chromium
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Timing Out

```bash
# Increase timeout in playwright.config.ts
timeout: 120000 // 2 minutes
```

### Element Not Found

```typescript
// Use proper waits
await page.waitForSelector('text=Element', { timeout: 10000 });

// Or use auto-waiting actions
await page.click('button'); // Automatically waits
```

### Flaky Tests

```typescript
// Add retries
test.describe.configure({ retries: 2 });

// Or use better selectors
await page.locator('[data-testid="submit"]').click();
```

### Browser Not Installed

```bash
# Reinstall browsers
npx playwright install --force
```

## Test Data Management

### Using Existing Data

Tests use existing data in the database:
- Customers
- Pets
- Services
- Resources (kennels)

### Creating Test Data

If needed, create test data before running:

```typescript
test.beforeAll(async () => {
  // Create test customer, pets, etc.
});

test.afterAll(async () => {
  // Clean up test data
});
```

## Performance

### Parallel Execution

```bash
# Run tests in parallel (default)
npx playwright test

# Run sequentially
npx playwright test --workers=1
```

### Sharding

```bash
# Split tests across machines
npx playwright test --shard=1/3
npx playwright test --shard=2/3
npx playwright test --shard=3/3
```

## Reporting

### HTML Report

```bash
# Generate and open HTML report
npx playwright show-report
```

### JUnit Report

```bash
# Generate JUnit XML
npx playwright test --reporter=junit
```

### Custom Reporter

```typescript
// In playwright.config.ts
reporter: [
  ['html'],
  ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results.json' }],
  ['junit', { outputFile: 'junit.xml' }]
]
```

- [ ] Add visual regression tests
- [ ] Add API mocking for isolated tests
- [ ] Add performance testing
- [ ] Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add accessibility tests
- [ ] Add mobile-specific tests
